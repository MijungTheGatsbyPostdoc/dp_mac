Mention

1. Which Tensorflow version you need to run this implementation, specify dependencies (need any packages to run this?)
2. Make sure you write down your name as an author in each page you wrote
3. Directories: you need "data" downloaded and stored somewhere to test this, so specify where you put that directory 
4. Write down the purpose of each folder, e.g. ,what they contain, where they're from (which paper to look at to understand MA), 
5. Add the link to our workshop paper, to the readme page here.
